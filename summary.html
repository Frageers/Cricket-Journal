    <h3 class="heading">Biotic component of the environment</h3>
    <p>Crickets are a part of the biotic part of the ecosystem. This is usually the part where all the liviing organisms are found. The biotic part works together with the abiotic part to create an ecosystem</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Biosphere</h3>
    <p>Since crickets are living organisms, they are found in the 4th sphere of the earth which is the Biosphere. This is the sphere where all the living organsims are found.</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Consumers / Heterotrophs</h3>
    <p>Since crickets cannot make their own food they eat other organsims. Organisms that can't make their own food are called consumers or heterotrophs</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Cellular respiration</h3>
    <p>Crickets perform an action called cellular respiration. In this process, they give out Carbon dioxide and take in oxygen. This can also be called breathing</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Omnivores</h3>
    <p>Crickets usually eat plants but may also eat other dead or crippled insects. Since they eat both plants and other insects, this makes them omnivore. Omnivore is basically an organism that eats both plants and meat.</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Scavenger</h3>
    <p>Since crickets eat dead or cripple insects, they can also be counted as scavengers</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Trophic level</h3>
    <p>Since crickets are omnivores they are placed one trophic level heigher than the primary consumers or the herbivores. This means that they are found on the third trophic level and are called secondary consumers</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Carbon Cycle</h3>
    <p>Since crickets perform cellular respiration, they are apart of the carbon cycle</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Reservoirs</h3>
    <p>In the carbon cycle since the crickets hold the carbon and are not the reason it moves from place to place, they are called a reservoir.</p>
