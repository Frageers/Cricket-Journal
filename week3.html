    <h1>Week 3</h1>

    <div id="day15Text">
        <h3>Day 15</h3>
        <p>Update on the name change, the crickets seemed to have started to be a bit more aggresive ans have tried to break out</p>
    </div>

    <div id="day16Text">
        <h3>Day 16</h3>
        <p>The crickets have continued what appears to be fits of rages as they have tried to break out more often than they did before the name change</p>
        <p>I suspect the reason for this is the name change or less frequent food during this week</p>
    </div>

    <div id="day17Text">
        <h3>Day 17</h3>
        <p>In an unfortunate series of events, the crickets died today</p>
        <p>They lasted pretty long but they died just before the finish lline which kinda sucks</p>
        <P>I'm not entirely sure why they died but it might have been because of the heat</P>
