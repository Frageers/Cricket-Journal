    <h3>Day 1</h3>
   
   
    <div id="day1Text">
        <p>The crickets seemed to be adjusting to their new environment</p>
        <p>They were very anxious throughout the day and seemed nervous</p>
        <p>They would not eat the grated carrots that were placed in the jar until later in the day</p>
    </div>
   
   
    <div id="day2Text">
        <h3 id="heading2">Day 2</h3>
        <p>The crickets did not seem to show any new behavior throughout the day</p>
        <p>One thing to note was that they were eating the older carrots vs the apple I placed before coming to school. </p>
        <p>This could have been due to the fact that crickets do not like apples so I put in more carrots but they still seemed to go for the older ones</p>
    </div>

    <div id="day3Text">
        <h3 id="heading3">Day 3</h3>
        <p>As I went out, I could not really observe the crickets during the day</p>
        <p>One thing to note today was that they finally started eating the newer fruit</p>
        <p>I'm not sure if it was because the older carrot had fuzz on it but this allowed me to take out the old fruits</p>
        <p>The reason I did not take out the older food was because I did not want them to stop eating</p>
    </div>

    <div id="day4Text">
        <h3>Day 4</h3>
        <p>I again went out so I could not observe them until night</p>
        <p>I am not sure why but the crickets seemed more energetic and where moving more compared to the other 3 days</p>
        <p>I suspect it may be because they started eating the newer carrots which had more moisture</p>
    </div>

    <div id="day5Text">
        <h3>Day 5</h3>
        <p>Today I played some music off a bluetooth speaker</p>
        <p>The reason this is interesting is becasause it looked like the crickets were attracted to it</p>
        <p>I may be overthinking this but the crickets did seem to be attracted</p>
        <p>In terms of music genres, the crickets were attracted to similar songs I enjoy. Some</p>
        <p>Some examples where this was most common was Stairway to Heaven, Bohemian Rhapsody, Enter Sandman, and Master of Puppets</p>
    </div>

    <div id="day6Text">
        <h3>Day 6</h3>
        <p>The crickets did not really show any new actions and mostly everything they did had been seen in previous days</p>
        <p>Today was also the first day of the blackjack experiment</p>
    </div>

    <div id="day7Text">
        <h3>Day 7</h3>
        <p>The crickets seemed less active today than all other days</p>
        <p>Maybe this was because they seemed to be eating less</p>
    </div>
