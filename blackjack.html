    <h1>The blackjack experiment</h1>
    <h3>This is the webpage summarizing the blackjack experiment I did on the crickets</h3>
    <h2>Rules:</h2>
    <p>Before we begin, I will set out some ground rules to try and reduce the outside factors that could help the crickets learn blackjack faster or make them learn it slower</p>
    <h3>The first rule is that no outside blackjack influence is allowed on the crickets</h3>
    <p>What this means is that only I will be able to do anything related to teaching the crickets blackjack</p>
    <p>This means no youtube video, not my brother or my parents or a friend, only me</p>
    <h3>We will also be excluding doubling and splitting as they can be hard to grasp</h3>
    <h1 id="summaryText">Summary</h1>
    <p>The first few days were all belonging to teaching the crickets the cards and their values</p>
    <p>When allocating the time slots for this experiment I only put down 5 days to teach them about the cards</p>
    <p>What ended up happening was it took 2.5 weeks so I had no time to get to the rules</p>
    <h1 id="conclusionText">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Due to the fact that I could not teach the crickets the rules, but I could teach them some of the cards, I will take it as a 10% success</p>
    <p>What I could have changed was making it easier for the crickets to tell me the value of the card</p>
    <p>What I did was show the card and they could go near the piece of paper which had the value of the card</p>
    <p>This could have lead to me understanding the crickets wrong</p>
    <h1 id="differenceText">What I would do different</h1>
    <p>If I could do things again what I would do differently is that I would make it so the crickets could tell me the value of the cards easier and with more accuracy with my understanding of what they were trying to say</p>
    <p>The first thought I had was like those buttons that help dogs speak but that be too hard for the cricket to press down</p>
    <p>Maybe I could also use normal playing cards because I used my golden playing cards which could have been a distraction for the crickets</p>
    <p>Another thing to change was maybe the incentive for the crickets</p>
    <p>I could have tried to identify what the crickets liked and used that as a prize instead of just adding more carrots after every successful session</p>
