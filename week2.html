        <h3>Day 12</h3>
        <p>As I was cleaning the jar of the crickets, one of them tried to get out of the temporary jar I placed them in</p>
        <p>When they were put back into the main jar, they tried to climb out of the jar but the kept slipping back</p>

    <div id="day13Text">
        <h3>Day 13</h3>
        <p>It appears the music taste of the crickets has changed as they appear to attract more towards the music my brother plays</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="day14Text">
        <h3>Day 14</h3>
        <p>I changed the name of my cricket</p>
        <p>Before the change, they were named after guitarists from famous rock bands</p>
        <p>Now they are named after dictators from WW2</p>
        <p>There wasn't really a change seen in their behavior but it might be to soon to say</p>
